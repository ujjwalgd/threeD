        <h1>Lucid Dreaming :)</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>
          "A lucid dream is a type of dream in which the dreamer becomes aware
          that they are dreaming"
        </h2>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          When you dream , you see a lot of weird , exciting , scary and amazing
          things . Some don't even make sense but still.. You believe in it .
          <br />
          Ever wonder WHY ? Why do you believe them when you know it's not
          possible ? Because when we sleep , the part of mind which is
          responsible for “making sense” is also sleeping .
          <br />
          <br />
          But imagine if You are able to awaken that part of your brain ! Then
          you are in another world like a parallel universe , But this time you
          know that this world is your mind's creation .
          <br />
          You are the GOD of this world . This is lucid dreaming .
